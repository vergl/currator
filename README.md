## Currency Exchange Rate API Proof-of-Concept Application

The idea behind this repository is to create 
a simple Java currency exchange rate app which 
then can be improved and become a cloud-friendly 
microservice application with the use of best practices 
in code quality, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
